Explorer Mode
Your app should have two models (id, createdat and updatedat columns are assumed on all of the below):
User: A user has a username, an email address, and a bio
Post: A post has a title, a body, an associated user, and a summary
A post can't be created without a user. It also can't be created without a title or a body
A user can't be created without a username or email.
Use your seeds.rb file to seed your development database with five users, each with a random number of posts.
Use faker to generate the data.
Use rails console to explore your data and update your app's README (by hand is fine) to give stats on the most-prolific user.

Adventure Mode
Add another model
Comment: A comment has a body and belongs to both a user and a post
A comment can't be created without a user or a post. It also can't be created without a body of some sort.
Add a posts_count columns to your users
Add a comments_count column to your posts
A user's posts_count column should reflect the number of posts that user has authored and update automatically.
A post's comments_count column should reflect the number of comments left on that post and update automatically.`
